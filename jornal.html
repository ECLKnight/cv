      My first step is to focus on <em>HTML</em>. I want to undersand the
      foundation of a web page. What gives it is structure. At the moment I can
      undersand how to set up a basic structure of a webpage. How to use the
      following tags <em>head</em>, <em>title</em>, <em>body</em>, <em>p</em>,
      <em>h(n)</em>, <em>br</em>, the difference between <em>em</em> and
      <strong>strong</strong>.How to create tables and structure them.
      <br />
      <br />
      Two key elements that I find most exential are hyper links and images.
      Hyper links allowed me to restructure the webpage in a whole new way. I
      don't have to have all the information cramp into a single page. Images
      allow me to personalise the page in a whole new way. It makes the webpage
      feel more mine.
